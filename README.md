There are going to be several projects that unfortunately, you will not be able to run, or see any results. 
The reason for this is to protect the identity of the client's who's information is being used. 
There are a set of files that are being read which consists of client's Date of Birth, Full Name, Address, Social Security Number and more. Originally, I wanted to use a random number generator to replace the SSN, and display results, but that does not eliminate the issue of displaying other sensitive information. The most efficient way to deal with this is to not show it at all. I apologize for this inconvenience and I hope the code attached is sufficient enough to understand what is going on. 


Some of the other projects in this repository are occurences of self-learning. This includes the ML KNR Project and MatPlotLib_Practice.


For one project (Payroll By Borough & Math), the final interactive visual isn't being shown on GitHub. However, when used on Jupyter Notebook, the output comes out as desired. As a result, I will be attaching a GIF of the visual in action.
